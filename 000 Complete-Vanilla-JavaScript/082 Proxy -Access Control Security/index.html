    <h1>Proxy in JS</h1>

    <p>
        A Proxy in JavaScript is an object that wraps another object (called the target) and allows you to intercept and
        customize operations performed on that target — such as reading/writing properties, function calls, enumeration,
        etc.
        <br>
        It’s like a middleman that sits between your code and the object, giving you a chance to modify how the object
        behaves.
