# Proxy 

1. Proxy lets you add custom behavior for fundamental operations (e.g., reading, writing, deleting properties).

2. Changes to proxyUser affect the original user because they reference the same underlying object.

3. You can use Proxies for:

    - Data validation

    - Logging/debugging

    - Access control

    - Virtual properties
