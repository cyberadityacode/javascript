This interactive UI demonstrates a fluid-filled container (styled as water) whose wave height changes dynamically based on a range slider input. It simulates the effect of “filling” or “draining” a container and visually represents the current level with both a moving label and a wave animation.

Key features:

A wave that rises or falls based on slider value.

A label that moves in sync with the slider's thumb and updates the value in real-time.

Smooth, animated wave effect using pure CSS @keyframes.

Custom scale function: Converts slider values from one range (0–100) to another (e.g., -95% to -200%) for mapping values smoothly.

Learning Highlights
How to manipulate CSS pseudo-elements using JavaScript through CSS variables.

Real-world use of range sliders beyond form inputs.

Mastery over dynamic styling using style.setProperty().

Improved visual feedback using motion and value sync.
